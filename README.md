# emurgo

1. Permutations
Input: a string of unknown length that can contain only three characters: 0, 1, or *. For example: "101*011*1‚Äù
Output: an array of strings where each string is a permutation of the input string with the * character replaced by a 0 or a 1. For example: for
input "*1" the result array is ["01", "11"]
Tasks: Implement the function/program that will give correct output for all possible inputs within given restrictions. Write a documenting comment
explaining the algorithmic complexity of the program.
